## Description

This is a full-stack web application built with JavaScript, Express.js, React, and PostgreSQL.

It was created as an individual project task for [Hack Your Future](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH) Denmark's curriculum.

The main functionalities of this website are:

-   Displaying the meals in the database
-   Searching for a meal
-   Making a reservation
-   Leaving a review
-   Sorting meals

## Technologies Used

-   Express.js
-   KnexJS
-   PostgreSQL
-   React
-   CSS Modules

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. Some of the challenges I faced include building a Star component for leaving a rating for a meal, a Modal component, and a Burger Menu for mobile displays.

Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of React, CSS Modules, and Frontend Development in general. I also learned how to work with Express.js, KnexJS, and PostgreSQL to build a full-stack web application.

In addition to these technical skills, I also learned how to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer.
